Each campaign will have a name => `campaign_name`
Each campaign will have a start date & an end date => `start_date`, `end_date`

For the registration process, we will know that all the users who completed the registration
during that campaign time frame, will be "registered" for that campaign which belongs to
a specific company.

If, down the road, there will be multiple campaigns running at the same time (more clinics),
the registration process link from the QR code will send the user to a "landing page" that will
have multiple companie to choose from. Each user will select the company where he / she belongs to and will start the
registration process for that company.
